# openaps
James Matheson APS

This is my implementation of OpenAPS. 

* install openaps using curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openaps/docs/master/scripts/quick-src.sh | bash -
* install mmhistorytools from https://github.com/loudnate/openaps-mmhistorytools
It includes a sample crontab file and a sample secret.ini.
